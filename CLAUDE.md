the file viewer should display a file based on type, i.e. extension
known code or other text files should display with appropriate syntax highlighting
known image types should show the image
known binary files like .exe .dll .mp3 show statistics relevant to the type
otherwise check whether the file is text or binary
if binary, show generic statistics
if text, show generic text
